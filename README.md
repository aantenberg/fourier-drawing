# Fourier Transform Drawing
## Phys 2260 Final Project
By Ethan Lior and Andrew Antenberg
## Overview
In this project, we use fourier series to approximate the x and y values of a given path. We can generate such paths from SVG files, allowing us to approximate very complex shapes with these two waves.
## How to use
Run the cells in fourier.ipynb!
